# React Query Basic Forum
 [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) is a ReactJS preconfigured data management library which gives you power and control over server-side state management,
fetching and caching of data, and error handling in a simple and declarative way without affecting the global state of your application.

I built a React Query 4 basic SPFx (SharePoint) forum application where I used many features of React Query, such as, fetching data with useQuery, globally handling query errors, using useIsFetching and useIsMutating hooks, dependent queries, initial query data, paginated queries, infinite  queries, imperative refetch, mutations with query invalidation, mutations with handling mutation response and mutations with optimistic updates and also how to suppress refetch. 

 You can download the package from [here](https://github.com/Ashot72/React-Query-4-Basic-Forum/tree/main/sharepoint/solution) and upload it to your Tenant App Catalog to run the forum.
